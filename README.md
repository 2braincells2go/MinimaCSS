# MinimaCSS ‚ú®

MinimaCSS is a minimalist CSS framework designed for simplicity and ease of use (Opinionated). Born from an idea in 2017 and brought to life in 2018 for my personal projects, MinimaCSS is a reflection of a vision to create a foundational CSS framework that empowers new developers and suits projects that require just the basics.

While it may not cater to the complexities of large-scale applications, its streamlined approach is ideal for budding developers, simple projects, and anyone in need of a lightweight, straightforward starting point.

### Why MinimaCSS? ü§î

In a world where front-end frameworks are often bloated and overly complex, MinimaCSS stands as a testament to simplicity. It's a throwback to the roots of CSS design, offering just enough to get you started without overwhelming you with options.

### Features üöÄ

- Grid System: A flexible, 12-column grid for layout management.
- Typography: Clean, readable typography settings.
- Buttons: Pre-styled buttons with basic interactivity.
- Forms: Simple form elements for quick integration.
- Utilities: Handy utility classes for spacing, visibility, backgrounds, text colors, and more.
- Responsive: Built with a mobile-first approach.
- Dark Mode : Dark mode Included by default
- Size : Less than ~15 kB minified and gzipped

### Examples üìö

Check out the directory called `/example` where all the components are used

## Installation üíæ

To get started with MinimaCSS, you have two options: download the compiled CSS directly or download the project, customise it and build your own css.

### Direct Download üì¶

Download the `minimacss.css` file from the `/dist` folder and include it in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to-minimacss/minimacss.css">

```

### Customization and Building üõ†Ô∏è

MinimaCSS is designed to be easily customizable. To create a version tailored to your needs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hardikforall/MinimaCSS.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Make your customizations: Edit the SCSS files in the /src directory to suit your project's needs. You can modify variables, adjust styles, or even add new components.

5. Build your custom CSS: Once you've made your changes, you can build your custom version of MinimaCSS by running:

```bash
npm run build
```
This command compiles your SCSS files and outputs a minified CSS file in the /dist directory.
And you're done! You now have a version of MinimaCSS that's tailored specifically to your project's requirements.

### About Documentation

As MinimaCSS originated as a personal project, extensive documentation was not a priority. Therefore, detailed documentation is not available at this time. The provided example is intended to be self-explanatory and should suffice for understanding how to use the framework effectively.
